# Matomo Ansible Role

Matomo is a self-hosted, open source web analytics application. This role helps you to set up [Matomo's default docker image](https://hub.docker.com/_/matomo/), and configure it for Traefik and MariaDB.

## Installing

To configure and install Matomo on your own server(s), you should use a playbook like [Mother of all self-hosting](https://github.com/mother-of-all-self-hosting/mash-playbook) or write your own.
